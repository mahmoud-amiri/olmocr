The 20 Most Important Mathematical Equations
A journey through the most elegant and influential formulas in mathematics
1. Euler’s Identity
2. Pythagorean Theorem
e
iττ + 1 = 0
a2 + b2 = c2
3. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
4. Maxwell’s Equations
Establishes that differentiation and integration are inverse
operations. If F is an antiderivative of f, the definite integral
equals F(b) - F(a). Revolutionized mathematical problem-
solving.
In right triangles, the hypotenuse squared equals the sum of
the squares of the other sides. Cornerstone of geometry with
applications in navigation and architecture.
