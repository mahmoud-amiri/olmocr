Advocacy in Action 447

stakeholders has occurred in other nations, with groups and individuals refusing to risk being appropriated into the industry's public relations ambitions. It now looks like that with vigilance, tobacco control advocates can easily foment similar distaste in many areas of the business community. Our actions sought to denormalise the tobacco industry by disrupting its efforts to take its place alongside other industries—often with considerable social credit—in the hope that it might gain by association.

Tobacco industry posturing about its corporate responsibility can never hide the ugly consequences of its ongoing efforts to "work with all relevant stakeholders for the preservation of opportunities for informed adults to consume tobacco products" (translation: "we will build alliances with others who want to profit from tobacco use, to do all we can to counteract effective tobacco control"). BAT has 15.4% and Philip Morris 16.4% of the global cigarette market. With 4.9 million smokers currently dying from tobacco use each year, and the industry unblinkingly concurring that its products are addictive, this leaves BAT to argue why it should not be held to be largely accountable for the annual deaths of some 754,600 smokers, and Philip Morris some 803,600 smokers.
