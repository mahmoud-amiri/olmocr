Things supported:
 - A prompting strategy to get really good natural text parsing using ChatGPT 4o (silver_data)
 - An eval toolkit for comparing different pipeline versions
 - Basic filtering by language and SEO spam removal
 - Finetuning code for Qwen2-VL (and soon other VLMs)

### Note: Font installation

You will probably need to install some fonts on your computer so that any pdfs you render come out looking nice.

```
sudo apt-get install ttf-mscorefonts-installer msttcorefonts fonts-crosextra-caladea fonts-crosextra-carlito gsfonts lcdf-typetools

```
